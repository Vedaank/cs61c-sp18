TESTING INSTRUCTIONS:

To run the tests we provided you, type './run-sanity-check.sh' from your project folder.
This will copy your alu.circ and regfile.circ into the 'tests' folder and then run the tests.

To see what happened during a test, you can go to tests and open the .circ files.
These are harnesses that are modified to have testing inputs in them.
You can tick the clock and see the outputs of your ALU, and compare them to what you would expect.
